## Some words are more frequent than others - what are the distributions of word frequencies?



## What are the frequencies of 2-grams and 3-grams in the dataset?



## How many unique words do you need in a frequency sorted dictionary to cover 50% of all word instances in the language? 90%?



## How do you evaluate how many of the words come from foreign languages?



## Can you think of a way to increase the coverage -- identifying words that may not be in the corpora or using a smaller number of words in the dictionary to cover the same number of phrases?
